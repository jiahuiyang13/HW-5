**Summary:**

Completed the implementation of the NewApptBook ADT using a doubly-linked list data structure, which includes a head and tail pointer. Implemented an iterator class within the NewApptBook class, featuring a cursor and a canRemove field. Ensured that the implementation maintains the specified invariant conditions, including consistency between prev and next links, proper handling of head and tail pointers, and maintaining the correct number of items in the list. Additionally, ensured that elements in the list are non-null and in non-decreasing order.

**Key Achievements:**

Implemented a doubly-linked list for the NewApptBook ADT, providing efficient insertion, removal, and traversal operations.

Designed the iterator class with a cursor and a canRemove field, allowing for efficient removal of elements during iteration.

Ensured that the implementation adheres to the specified invariant conditions, including proper maintenance of pointers, handling of head and tail pointers, and validation of the number of items in the list.

Developed a clear and symmetric code structure, ensuring that changes in one direction are mirrored in the opposite direction, which helps prevent bugs and ensures consistency in the data structure.

**Challenges Overcome:**

Managed the complexities of pointer manipulation in a doubly-linked list, ensuring that every change in one direction is appropriately mirrored in the opposite direction.

Addressed the challenge of efficient removal during iteration, leveraging the advantages of a doubly-linked list to unlink nodes instead of shifting elements to fill in gaps.

Successfully handled the validation of iterator versions and cursor consistency, ensuring that the iterator remains synchronized with the state of the list.

**Next Steps:**

Perform thorough testing of the implementation, including internal tests for invariant conditions, as well as efficiency tests to validate the performance of insertion, removal, and iteration operations.

Refine the implementation if necessary, focusing on improving efficiency and addressing any edge cases or potential issues identified during testing.

Continue to deepen understanding of linked list data structures and their applications, exploring advanced topics such as circular doubly-linked lists or optimizations for specific use cases.
